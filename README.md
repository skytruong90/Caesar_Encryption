# Caesar_Encryption

## Project Overview

This project is designed to explore and understand the principles of encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. By working through this project, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with basic cryptography concepts, particularly the Caesar Cipher, which involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed amount to encode a message.

## Features

1. Encryption: Convert plain text into encrypted text by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
2. Decryption: Reverse the process by shifting the letters back to retrieve the original message.
3. Customizable Shift Value: The shift value can be adjusted to demonstrate how different keys affect the encryption and decryption process.
